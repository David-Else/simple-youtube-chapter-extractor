# Text file source formats allowed

YouTubers can create the list of chapters in any way they like, the following are some common ones supported:

The time stamp in either `00:00` or `00:00:00` format followed by either:

`space` `title`:

```
03:00:00 Introduction
```

`)` `space` `title`:

```
⌨️ (00:00:00) Introduction
```

`space` `-` `space` `title`

```
02:00 - Introduction
```

The current regex used is:

`/(?<time>\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}|\d{2}:\d{2})\)?\s(\-)?(\s)?(?<chapterTitle>.*)/g;`.

## Extract chapters from text file

```
youtube-chapter-extractor [name of text file to process]
```

or if you did not install it and running from source file:

```
./youtube-chapter-extractor.ts [name of text file to process]
```

## Merge chapters into video file

- Use `MKVToolNix GUI` which contains all the functionality of `mkvmerge`

![chapter-file](images/chapter-file.png)

or

- Download `mkvmerge` from [the home site](https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html) and use:

```
mkvmerge \
  --chapters originalfilename_chapters.txt \
  -o output-file.mkv \
  input-file.mkv
```

or

- [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.bunkus.mkvtoolnix-gui) and use:

```
flatpak run --command=mkvmerge org.bunkus.mkvtoolnix-gui --chapters originalfilename_chapters.txt -o output-file.mkv input-file.mkv
```

# Development

`deno test` to run tests.

`deno --unstable lint youtube-chapter-extractor.ts` to lint.

## Suggested contributions

- Add more text chapter formats
- Add more tests
- Automate `mkvmerge` usage
- Automate `youtube-dl` chapter extraction from JSON file. The feature is currently broken in `2020.11.17`, `youtube-dl --write-info-json` results in `"chapters": null`

## Suggested things not to bother with

- Automating everything using the YouTube API. It has been done by https://github.com/gabrielfroes/youtube-chapter-extractor, and it seems to keep breaking and be too complex.
